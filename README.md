# Anomaly-Detection-Capstone-Project-Proposal
Data Collection: Gather time series or cross-sectional data from reliable sources. Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalise data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure compatibility with anomaly detection algorithms. Model Development: Implement at least two anomaly detection models to identify irregularities in the chosen dataset
